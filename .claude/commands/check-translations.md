# Check Translation Status

Analyze the translation status of Klipper documentation.

## Your Task

1. List all markdown files in the `/home/user/klipper_ko/docs/` directory
2. Check which files have been translated (if working with the klipper-translations repo)
3. Identify which documents are:
   - Fully translated
   - Partially translated
   - Not yet translated
4. Provide a summary with statistics
5. Suggest which documents should be prioritized for translation based on importance:
   - Installation and configuration docs (highest priority)
   - Common user guides (high priority)
   - Developer documentation (medium priority)
   - Device-specific documentation (lower priority)

Present the findings in a clear, organized format.
