# Validate Markdown

Validate markdown formatting in translated documents.

## Your Task

Ask the user which markdown file to validate, then:

1. Read the markdown file
2. Check for common issues:
   - Broken links or malformed link syntax
   - Missing or mismatched headers
   - Incorrect code block formatting
   - Trailing whitespace issues
   - List formatting problems
   - Missing line breaks where needed
3. Verify that:
   - All code blocks have proper language tags
   - All links are properly formatted
   - Headers follow proper hierarchy
   - Technical terms are preserved correctly
4. Report any issues found with line numbers
5. Offer to fix any issues if requested

Be thorough but focus on issues that would affect rendering or readability.
